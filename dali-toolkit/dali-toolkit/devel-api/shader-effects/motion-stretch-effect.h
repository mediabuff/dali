/**
 * @brief Creates a new MotionStretchEffect
 *
 * Motion stretch shader works on a per object basis. Objects will stretch in the direction of motion when they move, or if the camera moves.
 *
 * Animatable/Constrainable uniforms:
 *  "uGeometryStretchFactor"  - This scales the amount the geometry stretches along the motion velocity vector.
 *                              A smaller value means the geometry stretches less, larger it stretches more. Default 0.5.
 *  "uSpeedScalingFactor"     - This value is used to control how much to fade the actor near the edges, based on the
 *                              speed the actor is moving. When the actor is at rest this is not applied. Default 0.5.
 *  "uObjectFadeStart"        - The displacement from the centre of the actor that the actor will start to fade towards
 *                              its edges. This is used to prevent an unsightly hard edge between the stretched actor and
 *                              the scene. Depends on the values of the vertices in the vertex stream. When the actor is at
 *                              rest this is not applied. Default Vector2(0.25, 0.25), which is half way towards the edge for
 *                              an ImageRenderer::QUAD.
 *  "uObjectFadeEnd"          - The displacement from the centre of the actor that the actor will finish fading towards its edges.
 *                              This is used to prevent an unsightly hard edge between the stretched actor and the scene. Depends
 *                              on the values of the vertices in the vertex stream. When the actor is at rest this is not applied.
 *                              Default 0.5, which is all the way towards the edge for an ImageRenderer::QUAD.
 *  "uAlphaScale"             - Global scaler applied to the alpha of the actor. Used to make the stretched actor a bit more subtle
 *                              and reveal a bit of the background behind it as it moves. When the actor is at rest this is not
 *                              applied. Default 0.75.
 *  "uModelLastFrame"         - The model to world space transformation matrix of the actor in the previous frame.
 *
 * @return The newly created Property::Map with the motion stretch effect
