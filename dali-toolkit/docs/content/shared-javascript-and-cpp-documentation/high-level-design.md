## Main, Update & Render Threads {#dali-threads}

DALi uses a multithreaded architecture in order to provide the best performance and scalability.

 + **Event Thread:** The main thread in which application code and event handling runs.
 + **Update Thread:** Updates the nodes on the scene as well as running animations & constraints
 + **Render Thread:** OpenGL drawing, texture and geometry uploading etc.
 + **Resource Threads:** Loads images and decodes into bitmaps etc.
